# Watermark Removal Feature

This feature provides automatic watermark detection and removal from videos using AI-powered techniques and FFmpeg processing.

## Features

- **One-Click Removal**: "Find and Remove Watermarks" button that automatically detects and removes watermarks
- **Real-time Processing**: Background job processing with progress tracking
- **Multiple Removal Methods**: AI Inpainting, Content-Aware Fill, Temporal Coherence, and Frequency Domain
- **Advanced Detection**: Frame-by-frame analysis using OpenCV and image processing techniques
- **Quality Assessment**: Post-processing quality analysis and reporting

## How to Use

### From the Video Editor

1. Navigate to any video in your video editor (`/videos/{id}/edit`)
2. In the "Watermark Removal" section, click the **"Find and Remove Watermarks"** button
3. The system will:
   - Automatically scan your video for watermarks
   - Detect watermark locations and types
   - Remove all detected watermarks using the best available method
   - Provide progress updates during processing
4. Once complete, you'll receive a success notification and the processed video

### Advanced Options

Before clicking "Find and Remove Watermarks", you can expand the "Advanced Options" section to configure:

- **Detection Sensitivity**: 
  - Low: Fast detection for obvious watermarks
  - Medium: Balanced detection (default)
  - High: Thorough detection for subtle watermarks

- **Removal Method**:
  - AI Inpainting: Most accurate, slower processing
  - Content-Aware Fill: Good quality, medium speed
  - Temporal Coherence: Best for moving watermarks
  - Frequency Domain: Fastest processing

## API Endpoints

### Detect Watermarks
```http
POST /ai/watermark-detect
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "video_path": "videos/sample.mp4",
    "sensitivity": "medium",
    "detection_mode": "balanced"
}
```

### Remove Watermarks
```http
POST /ai/watermark-remove
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "video_path": "videos/sample.mp4",
    "watermarks": [
        {
            "id": "wm_123",
            "type": "logo",
            "location": {"x": 10, "y": 10, "width": 100, "height": 50}
        }
    ],
    "method": "inpainting",
    "quality_preset": "high"
}
```

### Check Progress
```http
POST /ai/watermark-progress
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "removal_id": "removal_123456"
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

1. **AIWatermarkRemoverService**: Core service handling detection and removal logic
2. **ProcessWatermarkRemoval**: Background job for processing watermark removal
3. **AIController**: REST API endpoints for watermark operations

### Frontend Components

1. **AIWatermarkRemover**: React component providing the user interface
2. **Video Editor Integration**: Embedded in the video editing page

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Frame Extraction**: Use FFmpeg to extract sample frames from the video
2. **Watermark Detection**: Analyze frames using GD library for:
   - Transparency patterns
   - Edge detection
   - Color consistency
   - Common watermark locations
3. **Removal Processing**: Apply FFmpeg filters based on detection results:
   - `delogo` filter for rectangular watermarks
   - `fillborders` for edge-based filling
   - Custom inpainting algorithms
4. **Quality Assessment**: Analyze output quality and generate reports

## System Requirements

- **FFmpeg**: Required for video processing and frame extraction
- **PHP GD Extension**: For image analysis and watermark detection
- **Queue System**: For background job processing
- **Sufficient Storage**: For temporary frame storage and processed videos

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database  # or redis for better performance
```

### Queue Processing
Make sure your queue worker is running:
```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **FFmpeg not found**: Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible in your PATH
2. **GD extension missing**: Install PHP GD extension for image processing
3. **Storage permissions**: Ensure write permissions for `storage/app/temp/` directory
4. **Queue not processing**: Start the queue worker with `php artisan queue:work`

### Error Handling

The system gracefully handles errors by:
- Providing fallback detection methods
- Logging detailed error information
- Returning user-friendly error messages
- Maintaining processing state for retries

## Performance Considerations

- **Video Size**: Larger videos take longer to process
- **Watermark Complexity**: Complex watermarks require more processing time
- **Method Selection**: AI Inpainting provides best quality but slowest processing
- **Background Processing**: All removal operations run as background jobs

## Testing

Run the watermark removal tests:
```bash
php artisan test tests/Unit/WatermarkServiceTest.php
```

The test suite includes:
- Service method validation
- Progress tracking verification
- Error handling testing
- Quality assessment validation
