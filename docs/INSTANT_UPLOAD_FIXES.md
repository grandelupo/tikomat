# Instant Upload Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Drag and Drop "Video field is required" Error

**Problem**: When users dragged and dropped files into the Instant Upload dropzone, they received a "Video field is required" error, but file selection via the file picker worked correctly.

**Root Cause**: The form data wasn't being properly set before the POST request was made. The `setData('video', file)` call was made, but the POST request happened immediately after without waiting for the form state to update.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the `handleSingleFileUpload` function to wait 100ms after calling `setData()` before making the POST request
- Removed the redundant `data: { video: queuedFile.file }` parameter from the POST request since the form data is now properly set via `setData()`

### 2. Multiple File Upload Support

**Problem**: The original implementation only supported single file uploads.

**Solution**: 
- Added support for multiple file selection and drag & drop
- Implemented a queue system that processes files sequentially
- Added visual feedback for each file in the queue with progress tracking
- Users can now:
  - Drag and drop multiple video files at once
  - Select multiple files via the file picker
  - See the status of each file individually
  - Retry failed uploads
  - Remove files from the queue

## Key Changes Made

### Frontend (`InstantUploadDropzone.tsx`)

1. **Queue System**: Added `QueuedFile` interface and `uploadQueue` state to manage multiple files
2. **Enhanced Drag & Drop**: Modified `handleDrop` to accept multiple files using `Array.from(e.dataTransfer.files)`
3. **File Processing**: Added `processQueue` function to handle files sequentially
4. **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced UI to show progress for each file with different status indicators
5. **Error Handling**: Individual error handling and retry functionality for each file
6. **Form Data Timing**: Fixed the timing issue by waiting for `setData()` to complete before POST

### Key Technical Improvements

- **Multiple File Support**: Added `multiple` attribute to file inputs
- **Sequential Processing**: Files are uploaded one at a time to avoid overwhelming the server
- **Progress Tracking**: Individual progress bars for each file
- **Status Management**: Each file has its own status (pending, uploading, processing, completed, error)
- **Retry Mechanism**: Failed uploads can be retried individually
- **Queue Management**: Users can remove files from the queue

## Usage

### Single File Upload
- Works exactly as before
- Drag and drop a single video file
- Or click to select a single video file

### Multiple File Upload
- Drag and drop multiple video files at once
- Or click to select multiple video files
- Files are processed sequentially with visual feedback
- Each file shows its own progress and status
- Failed files can be retried individually

## File Validation

- Maximum file size: 100MB per file
- Supported formats: MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, WebM
- Maximum duration: 60 seconds per file
- Only video files are accepted

## Technical Notes

### Why Sequential Processing?
Files are processed one at a time rather than in parallel to:
- Avoid overwhelming the server with multiple simultaneous uploads
- Ensure consistent AI processing quality
- Provide better user feedback and control
- Prevent resource conflicts during video processing

### Timing Fix
The original "Video field is required" error was caused by race conditions where the POST request was made before the form data was properly set. The 100ms delay ensures the React state update completes before the request is sent.

## Testing

Run the following test to verify the fixes:

```bash
# Test drag and drop functionality
1. Open the channel page with instant upload
2. Drag and drop a single video file - should work without "Video field is required" error
3. Drag and drop multiple video files - should queue all files and process sequentially
4. Use file picker to select multiple files - should work the same as drag and drop
5. Try uploading invalid files (non-video) - should show appropriate error messages
6. Test with files larger than 100MB - should show file size error
```

## Browser Compatibility

The multiple file upload feature works in all modern browsers that support:
- HTML5 File API
- Drag and Drop API
- Multiple file selection (`multiple` attribute)

This includes Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (latest versions).
