# Video Removal System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of the video removal system for Filmate, which allows users to remove videos from individual platforms while maintaining full error handling and graceful recovery.

## System Architecture

### 1. Backend Components

#### Core Controller Method
- **Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/VideoController.php`
- **Method**: `deleteTarget(VideoTarget $target)`
- **Route**: `DELETE /video-targets/{target}`
- **Authorization**: Uses VideoPolicy to ensure user owns the video

#### Video Upload Service
- **Location**: `app/Services/VideoUploadService.php`
- **Method**: `dispatchRemovalJob(VideoTarget $target)`
- **Purpose**: Dispatches appropriate removal job based on platform

#### Removal Job Classes
All located in `app/Jobs/`:
- `RemoveVideoFromYoutube.php`
- `RemoveVideoFromInstagram.php`
- `RemoveVideoFromTiktok.php`
- `RemoveVideoFromFacebook.php`
- `RemoveVideoFromX.php`
- `RemoveVideoFromSnapchat.php`
- `RemoveVideoFromPinterest.php`

#### Error Handling Service
- **Location**: `app/Services/VideoRemovalErrorHandler.php`
- **Purpose**: Categorizes errors and provides user-friendly messages and recovery suggestions

#### Retry Command
- **Location**: `app/Console/Commands/RetryFailedVideoRemovals.php`
- **Purpose**: Intelligently retries failed removal jobs based on error type

### 2. Frontend Components

#### UI Integration
- **Location**: `resources/js/pages/Videos/Show.tsx`
- **Feature**: "Remove" buttons next to successfully published platforms
- **API Call**: `DELETE /video-targets/{targetId}`

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Categories

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Expired tokens
   - Invalid credentials
   - **Action**: User must reconnect account

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Insufficient permissions
   - Account restrictions
   - **Action**: User must check account settings

3. **Not Found Errors**
   - Video already deleted
   - Invalid video ID
   - **Action**: Consider successful (video already gone)

4. **Rate Limiting Errors**
   - API quota exceeded
   - Too many requests
   - **Action**: Automatic retry after delay

5. **Network Errors**
   - Connection timeouts
   - Service unavailable
   - **Action**: Automatic retry with backoff

6. **Platform Errors**
   - API service issues
   - Internal server errors
   - **Action**: Automatic retry with longer delay

### Retry Logic

#### Retryable Errors
- Rate limiting: 30-minute delay
- Network issues: 5-minute delay
- Platform errors: 10-minute delay

#### Non-Retryable Errors
- Authentication failures
- Permission issues
- Account not connected
- Unknown errors

## User Experience

### Feedback Messages

#### Success Scenarios
1. **Failed Video**: "Video target removed from Platform. (Video was not successfully published, so no platform removal was needed.)"
2. **No Platform ID**: "Video target removed from Platform. (No platform video ID found, so no platform removal was needed.)"
3. **Job Dispatched**: "Video removal from Platform has been queued. The video will be removed from the platform shortly."

#### Warning Scenarios
1. **Job Dispatch Failed**: "Video removed from Filmate, but could not queue removal from Platform: [error details]"

#### Error Scenarios
1. **General Failure**: "Failed to remove video from Platform: [error message]"

### User Actions Required

#### For Authentication Errors
- Reconnect platform account in Connections page
- Ensure latest permissions are granted
- Try logging out and back into the platform

#### For Permission Errors
- Check platform account permissions
- Verify ownership of the video
- Reconnect account with full permissions

## Development Features

### Development Mode Support
All removal jobs detect development mode via `fake_token_for_development` and simulate removal operations with appropriate logging.

### Comprehensive Logging
- All removal attempts are logged with context
- Error categorization is logged
- Job dispatch success/failure is tracked
- Retry attempts are monitored

### Testing
Comprehensive test suite in `tests/Feature/VideoRemovalTest.php` covers:
- Basic deletion functionality
- Job dispatch verification
- Authorization checks
- Error handling scenarios
- User feedback validation

## API Integration

### Platform-Specific Implementations

#### YouTube (Google API)
- Uses `youtube.videos.delete` endpoint
- Handles token refresh automatically
- Supports specific error codes (404, 403, 401)

#### Instagram (Meta Graph API)
- Uses `DELETE /{media-id}` endpoint
- Handles Facebook Graph API responses
- Supports media not found scenarios

#### TikTok
- Uses TikTok Open API deletion endpoint
- Handles TikTok-specific response format
- Bearer token authentication

#### Facebook (Meta Graph API)
- Uses `DELETE /{video-id}` endpoint
- Similar to Instagram implementation
- Handles Facebook-specific error responses

#### Twitter (X API v2)
- Uses `DELETE /2/tweets/{id}` endpoint
- Handles tweet deletion responses
- Bearer token authentication

#### Snapchat
- Uses Snapchat Marketing API
- Handles story deletion
- Supports 204 No Content responses

#### Pinterest
- Uses Pinterest API v5
- Handles pin deletion
- Supports 204 No Content responses

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Queue Monitoring
- Failed jobs are stored in `failed_jobs` table
- Retry command can be run manually or scheduled
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Scheduled Tasks
Add to `app/Console/Kernel.php`:
```php
$schedule->command('videos:retry-failed-removals')->hourly();
```

### Manual Retry Commands
```bash
# Retry all failed removals
php artisan videos:retry-failed-removals

# Retry specific platform
php artisan videos:retry-failed-removals --platform=youtube

# Dry run to see what would be retried
php artisan videos:retry-failed-removals --dry-run

# Only retry recent failures (last 6 hours)
php artisan videos:retry-failed-removals --max-age=6
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**: All requests verify user ownership of videos
2. **Token Security**: Access tokens are encrypted in database
3. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in respect for platform rate limits
4. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all actions
5. **Error Exposure**: User-friendly messages without exposing technical details

## Performance Considerations

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: All platform API calls are queued
2. **Retry Backoff**: Intelligent delay between retry attempts
3. **Batch Processing**: Retry command can handle multiple failures efficiently
4. **Resource Management**: Job timeouts and attempt limits prevent resource exhaustion

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations**: Remove videos from multiple platforms simultaneously
2. **Scheduled Removals**: Allow users to schedule video removals
3. **Removal Analytics**: Track removal success rates by platform
4. **Advanced Retry Logic**: Machine learning-based retry optimization
5. **Real-time Status Updates**: WebSocket updates for removal progress
